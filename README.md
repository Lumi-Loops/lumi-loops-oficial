## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloudflare Workers Deployment

This project is configured to deploy on Cloudflare Workers using the `@opennextjs/cloudflare` adapter.

### Prerequisites

1. **Cloudflare Account**: Create a free account at [cloudflare.com](https://cloudflare.com)
2. **Wrangler Authentication**: Login to Cloudflare via CLI
   ```bash
   bunx wrangler login
   ```

### Deployment Workflow

1. **Local Preview** (recommended before deploying):

   ```bash
   bun preview
   ```

   This builds your app and runs it locally in the Workers runtime using `wrangler dev`.

2. **Deploy to Production**:
   ```bash
   bun deploy
   ```
   Your app will be deployed to `https://lumiloops-oficial.workers.dev` or your custom domain.

### Configuration Files

- **`wrangler.toml`**: Cloudflare Workers configuration (name, compatibility settings, assets)
- **`open-next.config.ts`**: OpenNext adapter configuration (caching, routing)

### Important Notes

- The app runs in the **workerd runtime** (not Node.js) on Cloudflare Workers
- Uses **nodejs_compat** compatibility flag for Node.js APIs
- Static assets are served from the `.open-next/assets` directory
- **Turbopack is NOT compatible** with Cloudflare deployment - only used for `dev` mode
- Production builds use the standard webpack bundler for Cloudflare compatibility
- For more details, see [Cloudflare Next.js Documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/nextjs/)
